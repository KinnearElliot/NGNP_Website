      <div class="description">
        The terra cycle of 2091 saw the new rift sector reeling from the fallout of the First War. Though the Iron
        Rebellion was victorious in pushing out the Centurion Empire, the Alpha Centauri VI conflict was only just the
        beginning. Unknown to the resistance, the Empire had continued to build its forces in other systems within the
        rift space, biding it's time. The next major surge of military activity surfaced on the edges of the Talos
        system,
        clawing its way into the new region.

        The Echus Operation was the first to fall, unprepared for the invading armada. Next was the crash sight, taken
        and
        stripped of its resources to further fuel the imperial machine. In response, the Iron Rebellion once again took
        up
        arms, establishing operations within the mountains of Zone13. There they planned their counter offensive and
        secured a parameter across the Badlands for the upcoming struggle. With war once again finding it's way into the
        new age of the rift, the promise of peace and exploration sat threatened, hanging on the edge of a knife,
        destined
        to succeed or doomed to fail. The system could only hold it's breath as the emerging conflict began spreading
        across the region, pulling all of Talos in with it.

      <div class="description">
        From their launching platform of Echus Operation, the Empire took their first crusade into Talos, starting with
        Tors
        Junkyard. The Scrapper had been known to fight against outside interference of his operations, his distain for
        authority fueling his drive to repel the invaders. This time however resistance would prove to be a pointless
        endeavor. After their discovery of his illicit activities stripping down illegal vessels, it seems his presence
        could no longer be tolerated. It was the excuse they needed to bring his operation under new management. In an
        arrogant display of strength, the Empire brought its full might to bear, laying waste to the scrappers scouts
        and
        ending all known local resistance to their mission. With Tors JunkYard now under control of the Centurion Empire
        and
        the Scrapper in custody for interrogation, the royal Armada could launch deeper into the system, bringing Talos
        one
        step closer to imperial rule.

    <div class="description">
      With the cooperation of General Mealtris, the Rebels began their supply line expansion into Solis Fae. In order to
      avoid drawing unwanted attention to the local residents, they were advised to post up in one of the longer
      abandoned biodomes a safe distance from the civilian regions. Recently occupied by the local marauders and
      raiders, it was never going to end peacefully, military force was going to be required to clear them out. Pushing
      through the main barricade, several mechs were lost on the breach, caught by rigged explosives. From there however
      the rebels were able to swiftly take control of the dome, clearing the stronghold of the many stolen war machines
      that had been accrued over the cycles. This solar expansion put them on the edge of their core supply line
      boundaries and within range of a direct conflict from the Empire, further raising tensions in the system and
      drawing ever more attention from the Empire.

      The workers of Crossing were discovered to be passing on equipment to the rebels under the Empires radar. Mechs,
      weapons, intel, all of it flowed through the area like the polluted rivers pouring from the factories. As the
      Empire caught wind of their activity they dispatched ground assault units to take full control of the area.
      Risking rebel influence in such a key choke point in the system could only lead to more damage in the conflict.
      During an interception of an experimental mech transfer, chaos devolved as the workers fought out of desperation,
      trying to hold off the assault team until the rebels could arrive. Unknown to the empire however, the workers were
      ready and able to use the war machine to it's full capacity, putting up a formidable resistance. The trained
      imperial forces were too much for the workers however, their full armoury on display as they bombarded the area
      with artillery strikes, ending the revolt. Imperial control of Crossing would prove useful to the Empires supply
      lines moving forwards, both in equipment access and movement, bringing them one step closer to their goal.

    <div class="description">
      Few places in the system are considered more dangerous or chaotic than the two great Salvage Silos, run by the
      Salvage Syndicates own Junker and Scrapper cousins. This was especially true for The JunkYard, feared system wide
      for the rogue AIs who relentlessly hunt intruders across its corroded planes. So when a breakdown of negotiations
      with The Junker himself lead to the rebels attempting to infiltrating the planets subsystems, what followed could
      only be described as a horror scene. The massacre that ensued was absolute. Though the rebels were mostly
      successful in infiltrating the Silos primary control sight, they were unfortunately unable to fool the Junkers own
      personal escorts', sentient AIs loyal only to their master. JunkYard, it seemed, had no interest in entertaining
      the war. Hoards of bloodthirsty machines swarmed the rebels on entry, tearing them apart down to the last soul,
      leaving nothing but scorched ash and mangled steel remaining. Despite their attempts to blend in, once discovered,
      the Iron Rebels were met with the oncoming rain of death they were so desperately trying to avoid. The Silo was
      determined to remain as neutral as it was chaotic.

    <div class="description">
      The rebels massacre at The JunkYard was legendary, but paled in comparison to the Empires. On receiving intel of
      the
      rebels slaughter, the Imperial officers opted for bribery, offering imperial equipment in exchange for safe
      passage
      through the rusted fields. How arrogant. The Junker was well aware of their previous exploits at Tors JunkYard,
      overthrowing his cousin from his domain. He spurned their offer, threatening violence upon their return.
      Humiliated
      and enraged, imperial black ops teams were swiftly dispatched to infiltrate the silos central control systems, and
      attempt to shut down the death machines. The Junker, however, was waiting for them.

      The Junker Mechs recognized the infiltrators on first sight, but allowed them to pass on their masters orders. On
      the doorsteps of the control center, a shadow descended upon The JunkYard. The black ops teams were mercilessly
      swept aside, missiles and lead pouring in from every conceivable direction. Where there was mangled steel left of
      rebels previously, only molten pools and blood remained this time. Avenging the Scrapper, the death machines were
      instructed to incinerate every pilot down to ash, stringing up any corpses that escaped the flames as a warning
      for
      future intruders.

      The message was clear. The JunkYard was off limits and the war would not be entertained on the Junkers hollowed
      grounds. Only death was offered here.

    <div class="description">
      A direct conflict between the rebels and the empire was always inevitable. The spark that set off the powder keg
      was the detention of the Scrapper, setting in motion a chain of events securing the longevity of the Talos
      conflict. Despite the Empires best efforts to subdue their prisoner, the Scrapper was still able to secure
      communications with the Rebels under their radar. Though, where he hid the communications device on his persons
      still remains a mystery. Experiencing first hand the Empires "mission" for order, the Scrapper felt only more
      distain for their presence, requesting assistance from the rebels. This transmissions were quickly intercepted,
      both sides now aware of the other intentions. This time there were no tricks, no plans, no complex navigational
      maneuvers, just a brute force confrontation. 2 rebel breacher units broke through the barriers to Tors JunkYard,
      meeting the imperial defense units head on. While the rebels fought with passion, their breacher units were vastly
      outgunned and outpaced by the imperial solders. Under the shadow of the scrappers corpse, both rebel lances were
      eventually gunned down, a fruitless operation meeting a painful conclusion. Tors JunkYard, it would seem, would
      remain under the Empires management, further fueling their war and securing their access points within the system.

      As the firestorm began to ravage through the system, the most fragile solar lanes were restricted in an attempt to
      reduce the loss of life. With the central access pathways cut off, the Empire moved to reinforce it's boarders,
      taking the opportunity to break in new recruits. Off the parameter of their desert outposts, the empire launched
      training assault operations across the sands. After months of enduring savage raids at their hands, the imperial
      unit was more than keen to wipe the indigenous marauders off the map. Meeting them head on at their home territory
      at Taurus Station, the new recruits poured into the chasm, eager for blood and glory. What they were met with
      however was a cascade of heavy ballistics, ones they recognized as missing from the raids. As they scrambled to
      gain composure in the chaos, they were guided by leadership to reform and recompose their units. The marauders
      were relying on the ballistics as their rusted mechs were no match for the imperial garrison. Pushing out the last
      of the Dune Raiders, the new recruits were met with glory and graduation, securing another boarder to Echus in the
      unlikely event the rebel scum would ever breach this far into the outer system.

      General Helix of the Talos military was assigned to protect Helios Station, safe guarding its access for
      authorized use only. So when the Talos government broadcast the ACCs charted asteroid paths to the void harbors,
      his eye rolls could be felt across the system. Could these idiots make his job any harder? On receiving the
      broadcast, the rebellion immediately sought for his assistance in using the station, it's safe to say he was less
      than enthusiastic about the idea. Spitting in the rebellions face, the general made his intentions clear, if they
      ever landed on the station without authorization he'd personally step on them with his own mech. Politics was for
      losers and General Helix had no interest in entertaining it, or the war. Desperate to expand into the empires
      region, the Iron Rebellion had no choice but to punch through the military's ground defenses to access the harbor.
      Treason charges could be dealt with later, lives were at stake. 2 rebel lances landed on the edges of the Void
      Harbor, mounting a duel assault of the facility. The General, with his elite sniper unit and bruiser squad,
      mounted a formidable defense of the station. While the first wave had some success pushing past some defenses, the
      second were cut down by the snipers, who quickly repelled the remainder of the rebellion. It was a close, brutal
      fight, but in the end Helios station was not ready to fall out of Talos control just yet, General Helix ensured of
      that personally.

      Lunar city, under the command of Admiral Yen of the Talos Navy, was a formidable stronghold, The ground defenses
      standing near impassible due to their towering barricades. To bypass this, the Empire was forced to engage orbital
      drop teams to land right in the heart of the city, though it was impossible to predict their landing locations.
      This was a fight for control. The imperial assault teams were partially successful in securing a number of control
      zones across the city, but were eventually overwhelmed by Admiral Yen's hardened naval pilots. Trained in long
      distance warfare, the scoped LHRs and howitzers were put to good use, shredding unprotected imperials down to
      scrap. Stag troopers on the ground secured additional locations, catching additional imperials passing through the
      militarized streets. The Admiral understood the damage that could be caused if the empire was allowed to get its
      hands on nexus harbor. Though, they'd still need to get around Command Helix of Helios Station for it to be of any
      use. With the empire pushed back to its space, options to cross into the rebel territory started becoming thin.
      Hopefully the asteroid anomaly would soon pass. And the empire could resume its direct course to the rebel home

      The losses from both the empire and the rebels was eveidently not enough to deter the factions from further

      from Taurus Station, the new pilots fulfilled their duty with honor, grinding down the Junkers forces,
      overpowering steel with flesh proving once again that humanity was still the superior race. With the Junker
      finally contained, all that was left was to strike at the true prize of the system, decapitating the Iron
      Rebellion and ending this sad resistance to true freedom once and for all.

      In a final desperate bid to expand into the system, the Iron Rebellion once again found themselves pushing into
      Tors JunkYard. The Empire had used its time well to reinforce the area, stripping down what resources it could
      from the Scrappers own supply. With the main gates barricaded, they had ensured there was only one way in and one
      way out, they had no interest in unwelcomed surprises. It was a feutile attempt from the rebels, their
      reinforcements had been worn thin over time as the Empire had encroached on their supply lines. Tors JunkYard
      would have placed them right within striking distance but it was a near impossible task at this point. The valiant
      attempt was only met with another brutal failure, they couldn't endure another loss and maintain what control they
      had left. At this point all they could do is prepare for what could be their final stand against the oncoming
      Centurion armada approaching Zone13.

      Beaten and pushed to the edges of the system, the Iron Rebellion stood on the brink of its annihilation.
      Centurions Armada had finally arrived at Zone13. The Empire was still desperate for retribution following the
      first war, reeling from an open wound that it couldn't heal. Sanitizing the system of this arrogant scourge was
      all that mattered now, Centurion would have his pound of flesh. With the first wave of landing mechs entering the
      outskirts of the city, the rebels defenses were quickly overwhelmed as the imperial forces exploited existing
      breaches in the walls. The rebel commanders had planned for months in case of an invasion, but their repeated
      losses had drawn it's toll. Moving into the city, the local knowledge of the area gave the resistors only a brief
      advantage as they again fell prey to the sheer numbers of war machines. With their final stand within the central
      city the last of the rebels were gunned down and the flame extinguished. The lessons of the first war were painful
      but instructive, there were no chances taken in this conflict. The Empire had won, Talos had been claimed and so
      began an era of order and stability. Glory to the Empire!
